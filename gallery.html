      <!--Main content-->
      <div class="center">
        <h1>My Works</h1>
        <p>Here, you can find some examples of my work.</p>
      </div>
      <ul>
        <!--Link to Hello World-->
        <li>
          <a href="Hello World.html">Hello World</a>
          <p>The classic Hello World. This is the first thing that most coders make when they learn how to code. The only difference with mine is that it has more things in it, like a picture, some lists, and a link to a text document. I added the stylesheet afterwards.</p>
        </li>
        <!--Link to Building Up HTML-->
        <li>
          <a href="Building Up HTML.html">Second HTML Activity</a>
          <p>This is the second activity I did for HTML. This one is very similar to the first, but has a little more complex stuff in it. For example, there are actual links here, one linking another website, one that does nothing, and another that opens a new tab. Plus some more lists. I also added the stylesheet later.</p>
        </li>
        <!--Link to Style Ex-->
        <li>
          <a href="Style Ex.html">Style Examples</a>
          <p>This is a small page with a few style examples that you can make in HTML. Extra styling was added later. Note that the "strong" and "b" tags do the same thing.</p>
        </li>
        <!--Link to lorem-->
        <li>
          <a href="lorem.html">Lorem Ipsum</a>
          <p>Lorem Ipsum text is what most placeholder text is made out of. It comes from an old Roman document and it jumbles up the words to make a paragraph that looks natural. In this page, I learned how to make collums and rows using bootstrap.</p>
        </li>
        <!--Link to We Rock!-->
        <li>
          <a href="We Rock!.html">We Rock!</a>
          <p>This page is the first page where I learned how to use JavaScript. I learned how to use the alert, confirm, and prompt boxes. It alerts you that we rock, asks you if you rock, asks you how much you rock, and alerts the results back to you.</p>
        </li>
        <!--Link to PizzaVariables1-->
        <li>
          <a href="PizzaVariables1.html">Pizza Variables 1</a>
          <p>Pizza Variables 1 has basically the same premise as We Rock. Except this time, it is a little more complex. There are more types of variables that use numbers and boolean strings.</p>
        </li>
        <!--Link to PizzaVariables2-->
        <li>
          <a href="PizzaVariables2.html">Pizza Variables 2</a>
          <p>The sequel to the first Pizza Variables. Pizza Variables 2 is event more complex than the last one, because it uses the console.log. Alerts, confirms, and prompts can be really annoying because they stop eveything on the page until they receive info. Using the console can make it less annoying. To see it, right click, press inspect, and click on the console button.</p>
        </li>
        <!--Link to SushiOrGingerTea-->
        <li>
          <a href="SushiOrGingerTea.html">Sushi or Ginger Tea</a>
          <p>Sushi or Ginger Tea is a little different from the previous JavaScript pages. This one uses the "if" and "else" statements to display a series of inputs. If you press ok, then a variable is set to true. If you press cancel, then a variable is set to false.</p>
        </li>
        <!--Link to SteakOrTofu-->
        <li><a href="SteakOrTofu.html">Steak or Tofu</a>
          <p>Steak or Tofu works the same as Sushi or Ginger Tea, but with more inputs. Instead of alerts or console.logs, it uses document.write, which makes info visible and less annoying. There four possible outcomes: yes to steak and tofu, yes to steak and no to tofu, no to steak and yes to tofu, and no to steak and tofu. I like how this one turned out because I managed to make all four outcomes work.</p>
        </li>
        <!--Link to SandwichClick-->
        <li>
          <a href="SandwichClick.html">Sandwich Click</a>
          <p>This is an interesting one. Using the power of clicks, you can eat three different types of sandwiches. The page will then alert you how many of each sandwiches you have eaten. I like this one too because I even managed to make little buttons for each sandwich.</p>
        </li>
        <!--Link to FGPT-->
        <li>
          <a href="FGPT.html">FGPT</a></li>
          <p>This is the probably the third HTML page I have worked one, but it is all the way down here because I did it all on my own. It was just for fun, and that is why it has so little content on it. Regardless, it goes on this page.</p>
        <li>
          <!--Link to Moving-->
          <a href="Moving.html">Island Mover</a>
          <p>This is my absolute favorite of the rest of these. Similar to FGPT, it too was created for fun and on my own (with the help of the internet). Essentially, it is a simple game where you move around and occasionally find objects. It may not look like much, but there is a lot of code behind the scenes. It took a lot of time to figure it out, but I'm really happy with this one.</p>
